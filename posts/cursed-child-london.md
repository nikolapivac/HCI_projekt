It’s Opening Night... again! Yes, after a period off-stage during the Covid 19 lockdowns in the UK, the award-winning play is returning to London.

The eighth Harry Potter story will continue in London within its two-part structure (in the North American productions, the play is being reimagined as a one-part experience) and is celebrating its big return with gorgeous new poster artwork. You can learn all about the artwork’s evolution here.

Reopening the West End production are Jamie Ballard as Harry Potter, Susie Trayling as Ginny Potter, Dominic Short as Albus Potter, Thomas Aldridge as Ron Weasley, Michelle Gayle as Hermione Granger, Phoenix Edwards as Rose Granger-Weasley, James Howard as Draco Malfoy, and Luke Sumner as Scorpius Malfoy.

The ensemble includes Lola Adaja, Samson Ajewole, David Annen, Valerie Antwi, Sue Appleby, Phil Cheadle, Craig Connolly, Robert Curtis, Tim Dewberry, Jim Fish, Thomas Gilbey, Jemma Gould, Rachel Hinds, Jordan Lang, Ronnie Lee, Katrina Lopes, Lucy Mangan, David Mara, Lucia McAnespie, Jayne McKenna, Kathryn Meisle, Gordon Millar, Ian Redford, Thomas Royal, Tom Sturgess, Joshua Talbot, Mark Theodore, Emma-May Uden, Madeleine Walker, and Wreh-asha Walton.

Seven children—Noah Alexander, Tom Quinn Alexander, Abby Barnes, Harley Barton, Chase Collard, Samuel Newby, and Cici Smith—alternate in two roles.

Welcome back, everyone!
