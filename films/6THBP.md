title: "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"
excerpt: "Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters are increasing their terror upon the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. Dumbledore persuades his old friend Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as a professor. There is a more important reason, however, for Slughorn's return. While in a Potions lesson, Harry takes possession of a strangely annotated school textbook, inscribed 'This is the property of the Half-Blood Prince'. Draco Malfoy struggles to carry out a mission presented to him by Voldemort. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Harry secretly work together to discover the method on how to destroy the Dark Lord once and for all."
