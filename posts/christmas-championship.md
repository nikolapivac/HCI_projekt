We all love a healthy, competitive quiz during the holidays. So, from Friday 26th November, we’re inviting you to take part in a special quiz championship for Christmas, comprised of three rounds across three weeks in the run up to the end of the year. And the best part is – you can compete for your Hogwarts house as you do it.

Yes, our quiz runs concurrently with the new televised quiz special, Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses, which launches its first episode 28th November. So, once you’ve quizzed along with us, you can test your acumen with Helen. Here’s a sneak peek.

Each round will be longer as we go through, meaning more points can be accumulated along the way! You’ll need knowledge of Harry Potter, Cursed Child and the Fantastic Beasts films during these quizzes – so make sure you’ve done your studying. And as you can imagine, they will be ascending in difficulty to really give your magical minds a thorough workout.

### Here’s all you need to get started:

1.Log in or register with us to get sorted into your Hogwarts house

2.Represent your house in the latest round of the Quiz Championship – you can also play previous rounds you may have missed

3.Your score (on your first attempt) will be added to your Hogwarts house’s total

4.Complete all three rounds to help your house compete for victory
